Hello,  

I'm the frontend engineer Sebastian and the person behind this development notes. There are some reasons, why I fired up this place: to get other developers informed about solutions I made and to have a playground, where I can push my skills straight forward. I'm also an frontend enginner at [plazz Entertainment AG](http://www.plazz-entertainment.com).
